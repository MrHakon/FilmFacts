"# FilmFacts" 

NOTE: This project is my solution to an assignment we were given at school. Because the assignment had very specific requirements, the result is not necessarily the same as if I were to create a website for real world use.

The assignment was to create a website that showed (very specific) information about a number of movies. The movies were stored in objects (object.js for movies, reviews.js for user reviews and genres.js for corresponding genres), and I had to use JavaScript to retrieve the information I wanted.

The website also had to be built for mobile first, and then scale up to bigger screens.

I have personally written these files:

HTML:
advancedSearch.html, index.html, lastborrowed.html, mylist.html, searchresult.html, v3_showmovie.html

JavaScript:
v1_lastBorrowed.js, v1_mList.js, v2_searchResult.js, v3_showmovie.js

CSS:
v5_project.css

The rest of the files were attached to the assignment!
